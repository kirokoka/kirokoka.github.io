<p style="color:#800000;">Well Traveler...You just HAD to jump right in?</p>
<p style="color:#800000;">Didn't you???</p>
<p style="color:#800000;">Sorry Traveler, you've startled a swimming Cottonmouth.</p>
<p style="color:#800000;">With venom that can kill in hours and a bad attitude, I'd say your time has come!</p> 
<p style="color:#800000;">I'm sorry to say Traveler, but your last few hours will be you worst.</p>
